# chrome-countdown

Thanks @fouad for the original https://github.com/fouad/chrome-countdown YC countdown clock.

I wanted a version of this for our startup, to show the # of days until our next planned raise (which we call a "Horizon KPI achievement" date).

To use this for your startup:
=================

1) update the icons with your company logo

2) update the manifest w/ your company info

3) in app.js change the end date on line 16 to taste, depending on whatever end date you want.

4) Then go to chrome://extensions, choose "developer mode" and "load unpacked extension".

That should be it!
